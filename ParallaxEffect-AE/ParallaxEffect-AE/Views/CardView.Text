The code can be further improved by enhancing its readability and reducing redundancy. Here's an improved version of your code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct CardView: View {
    let card: TravelCard
    
    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { proxy in
            let cardSize = proxy.size
            let minX = min((proxy.frame(in: .scrollView).minX - 30.0) * 1.4, cardSize.width * 1.2)
            
            Image(card.image)
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
                .scaleEffect(1.3)
                .offset(x: -minX)
                .frame(width: cardSize.width * 2.5)
                .frame(width: cardSize.width, height: cardSize.height)
                .overlay(OverlayView(card))
                .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 30))
                .shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.25), radius: 8, x: 5, y: 10)
        }
    }
}

struct SliderView: View {
    let cards: [TravelCard]
    let height: CGFloat
    
    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
                LazyHStack(spacing: 5) {
                    ForEach(cards) { card in
                        CardView(card: card)
                            .frame(width: geometry.size.width - 60, height: height - 50)
                            .scrollTransition(.interactive, axis: .horizontal) { view, phase in
                                view.scaleEffect(phase.isIdentity ? 1 : 0.95)
                            }
                    }
                }
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, 20)
            .padding(.vertical, 5)
            .scrollTargetLayout()
            .frame(height: height, alignment: .top)
        }
        .frame(height: height)
    }
    
    @ViewBuilder
    func OverlayView(_ card: TravelCard) -> some View {
        ZStack(alignment: .center) {
            Color(red: 0.10, green: 0.10, blue: 0.10)
                .opacity(0.6)
            
            VStack(spacing: 4) {
                Text(card.title)
                    .font(.title)
                    .fontWeight(.black)
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
                
                Text(card.subTitle)
                    .font(.callout)
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
            }
            .padding(20)
        }
    }
}
```

In this improved version:

1. The code for the `CardView` and `SliderView` has been organized into separate reusable components.

2. The `SliderView` now accepts an array of `TravelCard` objects and a `height` parameter, making it more flexible.

3. The `LazyHStack` is used instead of `HStack` to improve performance and reduce memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of cards.

4. Redundant `frame` modifiers have been removed, and the code structure has been simplified for readability.

By refactoring and organizing your code in this way, it becomes more modular and easier to maintain while retaining flexibility and performance. You can use the `SliderView` component in different parts of your app with varying sets of cards and heights as needed.

                    You can use the refactored `SliderView` and `CardView` components in your SwiftUI views by passing in the appropriate data. Here's an example of how to use them:

                    First, make sure you have your `TravelCard` model defined:

                    ```swift
                    struct TravelCard: Identifiable {
                        let id = UUID()
                        let image: String
                        let title: String
                        let subTitle: String
                    }
                    ```

                    Now, you can use the `SliderView` in your SwiftUI views as follows:

                    1. Import SwiftUI.

                    2. Create an array of `TravelCard` objects.

                    3. Use the `SliderView` with the array of cards and specify the desired height.

                    Here's an example for the main slider:

                    ```swift
                    import SwiftUI

                    struct ContentView: View {
                        let travelCards: [TravelCard] = [
                            TravelCard(image: "Pic1", title: "Santorini", subTitle: "Greece"),
                            TravelCard(image: "Pic2", title: "Maldives", subTitle: "Archipelagic"),
                            TravelCard(image: "Pic3", title: "Cappadocia", subTitle: "Turkey"),
                        ]

                        var body: some View {
                            SliderView(cards: travelCards, height: 500)
                        }
                    }

                    struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
                        static var previews: some View {
                            ContentView()
                        }
                    }
                    ```

                    And here's an example for the mini slider:

                    ```swift
                    import SwiftUI

                    struct MiniSliderView: View {
                        let miniTravelCards: [TravelCard] = [
                            TravelCard(image: "MiniPic1", title: "Mini Santorini", subTitle: "Mini Greece"),
                            TravelCard(image: "MiniPic2", title: "Mini Maldives", subTitle: "Mini Archipelagic"),
                            TravelCard(image: "MiniPic3", title: "Mini Cappadocia", subTitle: "Mini Turkey"),
                        ]

                        var body: some View {
                            SliderView(cards: miniTravelCards, height: 200)
                        }
                    }

                    struct MiniSliderView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
                        static var previews: some View {
                            MiniSliderView()
                        }
                    }
                    ```

                    In these examples, we create arrays of `TravelCard` objects and pass them to the `SliderView` component along with the desired height. You can customize the card data and appearance as needed for both the main slider and the mini slider.
